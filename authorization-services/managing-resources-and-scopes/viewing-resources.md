# Viewing Resources

On the **Resource** page, you see a list of the resources associated with a resource server.

Resources

![Resources](https://wjw465150.gitbooks.io/keycloak-documentation/content/authorization\_services/keycloak-images/resource/view.png)

The resource list provides information about the protected resources, such as:

* Type
* URI
* Owner
* Associated scopes, if any
* Associated permissions

From this list, you can also directly create a permission by clicking **Create Permission** for the resource for which you want to create the permission.

| Note | Before creating permissions for your resources, be sure you have already defined the policies that you want to associate with the permission. |
