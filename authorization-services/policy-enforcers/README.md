# Policy Enforcers

Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is a design pattern and as such you can implement it in different ways. Keycloak provides all the necessary means to implement PEPs for different platforms, environments, and programming languages. Keycloak presents a RESTful API, and leverages OAuth2 authorization capabilities for fine-grained authorization using a centralized authorization server.
