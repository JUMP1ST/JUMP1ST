# Installing Distribution Files

The Keycloak Server is contained in one distribution file:

* 'keycloak-SNAPSHOT.\[zip|tar.gz]'

The 'keycloak-SNAPSHOT.\[zip|tar.gz]' file is the server only distribution. It contains nothing other than the scripts and binaries to run the Keycloak server.

To unpack these files run the `unzip` or `gunzip` and `tar` utilities.
