# User Account Service

1. After creating the user, log out of the management console by clicking the right dropdown menu and selecting **Sign Off**.
2.  Log in to the User Account Service of your `demo` realm with the user you just created by clicking this link:

    User Account Link

    [http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/demo/account](http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/demo/account)
3.  Type the username and password you created previously. You must create a permanent password after you successfully log in if you didnâ€™t toggle the Temporary switch to **Off** previously.

The User Account Service page opens. Every user in a realm has access to this Account Service by default. You can update profile information and change or add additional credentials. For more information on this service see the [Server Administration](https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/server\_admin/index.html).
