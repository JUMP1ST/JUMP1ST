# Java Adapters

Keycloak comes with a range of different adapters for Java application. Selecting the correct adapter depends on the target platform.

All Java adapters share a set of common configuration options described in the [Java Adapters Config](https://wjw465150.gitbooks.io/keycloak-documentation/content/securing\_apps/topics/oidc/java/java-adapter-config.html#\_java\_adapter\_config) chapter.
