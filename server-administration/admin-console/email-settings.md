Keycloak sends emails to users to verify their email address, when they forget their passwords, or when an admin needs to receive notifications about a server event. To enable Keycloak to send emails you need to provide Keycloak with your SMTP server settings. This is configured per realm. Go to the `Realm Settings` left menu item and click the `Email` tab.

As emails are used for recovering usernames and passwords itâ€™s recommended to use SSL or TLS, especially if the SMTP server is on an external network. To enable SSL click on `Enable SSL` or to enable TLS click on `Enable TLS`. You will most likely also need to change the `Port` (the default port for SSL/TLS is 465).

If your SMTP server requires authentication click on `Enable Authentication` and insert the `Username` and `Password`.
