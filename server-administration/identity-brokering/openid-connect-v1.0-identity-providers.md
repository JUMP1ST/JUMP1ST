# OpenID Connect v1.0 Identity Providers

Keycloak can broker identity providers based on the OpenID Connect protocol. These IDPs must support the [Authorization Code Flow](https://wjw465150.gitbooks.io/keycloak-documentation/content/server\_admin/topics/sso-protocols/oidc.html#\_oidc) as defined by the specification in order to authenticate the user and authorize access.

To begin configuring an OIDC provider, go to the `Identity Providers` left menu item and select `OpenID Connect v1.0` from the `Add provider` drop down list. This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

Add Identity Provider

The initial configuration options on this page are described in [General IDP Configuration](https://wjw465150.gitbooks.io/keycloak-documentation/content/server\_admin/topics/identity-broker/configuration.html#\_general-idp-config). You must define the OpenID Connection configuration options as well. They basically describe the OIDC IDP you are communicating with.

| Configuration            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Authorization URL        | Authorization URL endpoint required by the OIDC protocol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Token URL                | Token URL endpoint required by the OIDC protocol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Logout URL               | Logout URL endpoint defined in the OIDC protocol. This value is optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Backchannel Logout       | Backchannel logout is a background, out-of-band, REST invocation to the IDP to logout the user. Some IDPs can only perform logout through browser redirects as they may only be able to identity sessions via a browser cookie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| User Info URL            | User Info URL endpoint defined by the OIDC protocol. This is an endpoint from which user profile information can be downloaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Client ID                | This realm will act as an OIDC client to the external federation IDP you are configuring here. Your realm will need a OIDC client ID when using the Authorization Code Flow to interact with the external IDP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Client Secret            | This realm will need a client secret to use when using the Authorization Code Flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Issuer                   | Responses from the IDP may contain an issuer claim. This config value is optional. If specified, this claim will be validated against the value you provide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Default Scopes           | Space-separated list of OIDC scopes to send with the authentication request. The default is `openid`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Prompt                   | Another optional switch. This is the prompt parameter defined by the OIDC specification. Through it you can force re-authentication and other options. See the specification for more details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Validate Signatures      | Another optional switch. This is to specify if Keycloak will verify the signatures on the external ID Token signed by this Identity provider. If this is on, the Keycloak will need to know the public key of the external OIDC identity provider. See below for how to setup it. WARNING: For the performance purposes, Keycloak caches the public key of the external OIDC identity provider. If you think that private key of your Identity provider was compromised, it is obviously good to update your keys, but it’s also good to clear the keys cache. See [Clearing the cache](https://wjw465150.gitbooks.io/keycloak-documentation/content/server\_admin/topics/realms/cache.html#\_clear-cache) section for more details. |
| Use JWKS URL             | Applicable if `Validate Signatures` is on. If the switch is on, then identity provider public keys will be downloaded from given JWKS URL. This allows great flexibility because new keys will be always re-downloaded again when identity provider generates new keypair. If the switch is off, then public key (or certificate) from the Keycloak DB is used, so when identity provider keypair changes, you always need to import new key to the Keycloak DB as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| JWKS URL                 | URL where identity provider keys in JWK format are stored. See [JWK specification](https://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key.html) for more details. If you use external Keycloak identity provider, then you can use URL like [http://broker-keycloak:8180/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/certs](http://broker-keycloak:8180/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/certs) assuming your brokered Keycloak is running on [http://broker-keycloak:8180](http://broker-keycloak:8180/) and it’s realm is `test` .                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Validating Public Key    | Applicable if `Use JWKS URL` is off. Here is the public key in PEM format that must be used to verify external IDP signatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Validating Public Key Id | Applicable if `Use JWKS URL` is off. This field specifies ID of the public key in PEM format. This config value is optional. As there is no standard way for computing key ID from key, various external identity providers might use different algorithm from Keycloak. If the value of this field is not specified, the validating public key specified above is used for all requests regardless of key ID sent by external IDP. When set, value of this field serves as key ID used by Keycloak for validating signatures from such providers and must match the key ID specified by the IDP.                                                                                                                                    |

You can also import all this configuration data by providing a URL or file that points to OpenID Provider Metadata (see OIDC Discovery specification). If you are connecting to a Keycloak external IDP, you can import the IDP setttings from the url `<root>/auth/realms/{realm-name}/.well-known/openid-configuration`. This link is a JSON document describing metadata about the IDP.
