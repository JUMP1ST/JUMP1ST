# Generating Client Adapter Config

The Keycloak can pre-generate configuration files that you can use to install a client adapter for in your applicationâ€™s deployment environment. A number of adapter types are supported for both OIDC and SAML. Go to the `Installation` tab of the client you want to generate configuration for.

Select the `Format Option` you want configuration generated for. All Keycloak client adapters for OIDC and SAML are supported. The mod-auth-mellon Apache HTTPD adapter for SAML is supported as well as standard SAML entity descriptor files.
