# Threat Model Mitigation

This chapter discusses possible security vulnerabilities any authentication server could have and how Keycloak mitigates those vulnerabilities. A good list of potential vulnerabilities and what security implementations should do to mitigate them can be found in the [OAuth 2.0 Threat Model](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819) document put out by the IETF. Many of those vulnerabilities are discussed here.
