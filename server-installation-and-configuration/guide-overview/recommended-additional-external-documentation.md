# Recommended Additional External Documentation

Keycloak is built on top of the Wildfly application server and itâ€™s sub-projects like Infinispan (for caching) and Hibernate (for persistence). This guide only covers basics for infrastructure-level configuration. It is highly recommended that you peruse the documentation for Wildfly and its sub projects. Here is the link to the documentation:
